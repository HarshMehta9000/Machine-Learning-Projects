ML Projects
Welcome to my ML Projects repository! This collection contains 32 detailed projects, each documenting my journey to understand and apply machine learning concepts. Every project represents an honest attempt to explore, learn, and document machine learning techniques, ranging from basic data preprocessing to advanced deep learning models.

Each notebook is carefully structured with:

Purpose: Explains the objective of the project.
Approach: Details the methodology and algorithms used.
Key Visualizations: Highlights important plots and graphs.
Insights: Summarizes findings and takeaways.
